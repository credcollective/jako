* **Zero setup:** There is no need to configure _jako_, and setting it up is as easy as moving your current scripts to a folder.

* **Polyglot:** You are free to write your scripts using any language you want.

* **Translucent:** Forget about build tools that force you to write code that only work for that specific runner. As a principle, all the scripts run by _jako_ need to be executable also without _jako_. No vendor lock, less API to keep track of.

* **Extensible and modular:** _jako_ doesn't hold you back while your project is growing. Encapsulate as many independent projects as you want in a single repo and _jako_ will let you run all your scripts from a centralized place.

The name `jako` comes from "**jak**e + **o**pinionated". Under the hood, it combines the maturity of a battle-tested codebase with a modern architecture.

> Jake is the JavaScript build tool for NodeJS. Jake has been around since the very early days of Node, and is very full featured and well tested.

In essence, _jako_ is just a tiny but powerful wrapper around jake.
